# Validation Step 1

* **Major Step Description**:
  * Test `hera_pspec`'s ability to recover EoR P(k) from visibility simulations including 
    unpolarized foregrounds and noise. This includes tests with different amounts of 
    coherent and incoherent averaging. Error bars should correctly be predicted from 
    noise and signal levels.
