# Validation Step 0

**Major Step Description**: Simulate sky-locked white-noise P(k) and estimtae PS with ``PSpec``.
**Pipelines Tested**: ``hera_pspec``.

## Minor Variations

### 0.0 -- Flat P(k)

**Minor Step Description**: Generate flat-spectrum P(k) as per major step description.
**Conditions for success**: Ensemble-averaged P(k) agrees with analytic expectation to within the predicted mean standard error. Potential inflation of variance from ``hera_pspec`` inaccuracies up to 1% allowable.

### 0.1 -- Non-Flat P(k)

**Minor Step Description**: Generate non-flat-spectrum P(k) as per major step description.
**Conditions for success**: Ensemble-averaged P(k) agrees with analytic expectation to within the predicted mean standard error. Potential inflation of variance from ``hera_pspec`` inaccuracies up to 1% allowable.
